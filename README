README

This is a short python script that converts Memory words and longs into a listing of what bits are on given a certain decimal value.

It's primary purpose is to allow a quick calculation to be performed in the process of troubleshooting primary logical controllers that read out MW's and ML's as decimal values.

Assuming that the individual bits cannot be cross-referenced from the word, this cuts down on figuring out the "why is it this value?" step.
